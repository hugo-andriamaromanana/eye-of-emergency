# Eye of Emergency
Eye of Emergency is a machine learning project focused on tweet classification. The project uses various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and analyze tweet data, and then applies machine learning models to classify the tweets.
Technique used:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Xgboost
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree


## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories:

- [`data/`](data/): Contains raw and processed tweet data.
- [`exploratory/`](exploratory/): Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data exploration, cleaning, and model comparison.
watch/: Contains markdown files with information about Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- [`scripts/models/`](scripts/models/): Contains trained machine learning models.
